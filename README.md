This repository contains code and scripts for the (re-)analysis of a discrete choice experiment dataset focusing on consumer preferences for tablet computers for the course Customer Satisfaction and Consumer Choice (CSCC) by Prof. Otter. The project includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, and the estimation of a baseline multinomial logit (MNL) model, and acts as a reference in our seminar paper.
