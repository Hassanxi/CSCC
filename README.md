**Overview**
This repository contains code and scripts for the (re-)analysis of a discrete choice experiment dataset that focuses on consumer preferences for tablet computers. The analysis was performed as part of the Customer Satisfaction and Consumer Choice (CSCC) course, taught by Prof. Otter. The project encompasses all steps from data preparation and exploratory analysis to the estimation of a baseline multinomial logit (MNL) model. These materials serve as a reference for our seminar paper and further research in the field of quantitative marketing.
